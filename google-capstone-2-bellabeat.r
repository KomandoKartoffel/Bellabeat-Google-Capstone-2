Its not mandatory for me to do a second one, but I'd like to challenge myself to give myself some more practice.\n\n-- Read \"Note\" below --\n\n### Briefing\nThe case study this time is about Bellabeat, unlike the 1st case study, Bellabeat is a real company that specialize in making \"Fashionable Fitness Tracker for Women\" https://bellabeat.com/.\n\nThe case study tasked me in answering the business problem in the following section, using dataset generated by Fitbit users as a benchmark/prediction on how users engage with their fitness tracker on a daily basis.\n\n\n### Business Objective & Business Problem\n\"The company continues to grow and are trying to find more opportunities for growth, thus the insight from the data will be used as high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.\"\n\nIn this case study, I'm tasked in analyzing smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices.\nThen select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation\n\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n\n### Data Source\nData is sourced from [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) by [MÃ¶bius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic), which in turned retrieved and collected from [Furberg, R., Brinton, J., Keating, M., & Ortiz, A. (2016). Crowd-sourced Fitbit datasets in zenodo.org .](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.53894)\n\nIt is a data collected from 30 conseting & eligeble participanting Fitbit users, collected from 12th March 2016 to 12th May 2016.\nThe idea is to use this data to predict and estimate user's engagement with the smart gadgets, so that Bellabeat as a company can anticipate which smart fitness gadge would be most popular.\n\nThis dataset contains 18 csv files, containing user's heart rate, estimated calorie usage, sleeping/exercising activity and it's quality/intensity - all recorded in a daily, hourly and minute basis. Although I won't go over every single column of each csv, I will discuss the main csv file \"daily activity merged\".\n\nFull documentation can be found [in this pdf.](https://www.fitabase.com/media/1930/fitabasedatadictionary102320.pdf)\n\n### Note\nThe data cleaning, processing, and analysis in this notebook will be done in R, but as since I also wanted to practice my SQL fluency, I've also made a file that contains MySQL queries that I made to work with this data. You can find said file in my [github.](https://github.com/KomandoKartoffel/Bellabeat-Google-Capstone-2)","metadata":{"_uuid":"d56707c4-c0ef-4128-b049-f7506ebb4f1b","_cell_guid":"aa350669-177a-47bf-b4e1-b158b0c40a63","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Cleaning & Processing\n### Loading \n#### SQL\n\n#### R\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"e5c39b43-6f8f-4f2b-8dd3-f5c638bdeabe","_cell_guid":"1170ddca-7bcd-4473-aabd-deba0c286306","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Cleaning","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Processing\n#### SQL","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Analysis\n### KPI & Important Variables\n\n### Exploration","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"---\ntitle: 'Your title here'\nauthor: 'Your name here'\ndate: '`r Sys.Date()`'\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    number_sections: true\n    toc: true\n---\n\n## Importing packages\n\nThis R environment comes with many helpful analytics packages installed\nIt is defined by the kaggle/rstats Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-rstats\nFor example, here's a helpful package to load\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # metapackage of all tidyverse packages\n```\n\n## Running code\n\nIn a notebook, you can run a single code cell by clicking in the cell and then hitting \nthe blue arrow to the left, or by clicking in the cell and pressing Shift+Enter. In a script, \nyou can run code by highlighting the code you want to run and then clicking the blue arrow\nat the bottom of this window.\n\n## Reading in files\n\nInput data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\nFor example, running the code below will list all files under the input directory\n\n```{r}\nlist.files(path = \"../input\")\n```\n\n## Saving data\n\nYou can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved \nas output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \nYou can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session\n\n## Plotting data and output visuals\n\nRmarkdown scripts can display plots inline with the flow of the analysis. Here is an example for an in-built dataset:\n\n```{r}\nmtcars %>% \n  ggplot(aes(hp, mpg)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Horse Power\", y = \"Miles per Gallon\", title = \"Car Parameters\")\n```","metadata":{"_uuid":"f1f10655-f6a7-4c76-bf2a-67d5a3c3d2c6","_cell_guid":"05731b92-b2bf-4bd1-8812-aeb59d918c3d","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Reference & Appendix\n#### Sources\n- Furberg, R., Brinton, J., Keating, M., & Ortiz, A.
